# Description

This is the source code for my personal website [https://mathisbd.github.io/](https://mathisbd.github.io/).

# Development 

I use [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) to build this website. The contents (pages and blog posts) are written in markdown, styling is done using HTML and CSS and the plumbing is done in Haskell.

Source files are in src/ and the latest build is in docs/. Run `make` to build the website.
