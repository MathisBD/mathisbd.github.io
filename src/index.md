I am a 4-th year computer science student at [ENS Paris][ens], currently doing an internship at [Inria Saclay][inria-saclay] in [Deducteam][deducteam]. I'm interested in pushing the automation aspect of proof assistants such as [Rocq][rocq], [Agda][agda], and [Lean][lean].

- I will start a PhD with [Yannick Forster][yannick-forster] and [François Pottier][françois-pottier] around September 2025, working on meta-programming in proof assistants (mainly Rocq).
