title: About me
---

I am a 4-th year computer science student at [ENS Paris][ens], currently doing an internship at [Inria][inria] in the [Cambium team][cambium]. I'm interested in pushing the automation aspect of proof assistants such as [Coq][coq] or [Lean][lean]. 

Previously I worked on compiling functional languages to GPUs with [Mary Sheeran][mary-sheeran] in Gothenburg.

# News

- I started an internship with [Yannick Forster][yannick-forster] in September 2024, working on metaprogramming in proof assistants based on dependent type theory.     
- From March to August 2024 I did my Master's internship with [Benjamin Werner][benjamin-werner]. We worked on Actema ([try it][actema-website] !), a graphical user interface for Coq based on a drag-and-drop formalism. Take a look at [this paper][actema-paper] for more details on Actema.
